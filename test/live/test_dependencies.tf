# Deliberately NOT reusing any shared/production resource group: writing into
# a shared RG usually requires elevated, non-sandbox permissions. A dedicated
# throwaway RG here needs only Contributor on the sandbox subscription and
# can never collide with or affect any production resource.
#
# terraform-azurerm-caf-storage_account does not consume a
# virtual_network/subnet input directly, so no vnet dependency is created
# here.
